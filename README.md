# ProjectOneClock
ProjectOneClock is a program written in C++ that displays a 12- and 24- hour clock. The program displays a menu that allows the end users to Add an hour, minute second or exit. From there the program will display both clock simultaneously. 

What did you do particularly well?
  In this project I excelled with quickly developing the solution to display these clocks. In addition to developing the code, I was able to write the code in a way that is easily read and this was due to the codes organization.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could enhance my code by making a clear screen function. This would remove repetition in code, allowing the program to run more efficiently. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Upon writing this, I found it was most challenging to utilize the header file. I overcame this by seeking outside reseources to better understand what and how a header file is used. This has been vital information as I continued through the course. The tools I used were Microsoft Learn. Further, I have utilized these skills in my personal projects. I understand how important header files are when it comes to secure coding.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The header and inline coding has made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Because I have inline comments throughout out my code there is a no question why or what I did in a portion of code. This allows the code to me easily changed in the future.
